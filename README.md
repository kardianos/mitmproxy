# mitmproxy


[Mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) implemented with golang. Intercept HTTP & HTTPS requests and responses and modify them.

## Features

- Intercept HTTP & HTTPS requests and responses and modify them on the fly
- SSL/TLS certificates for interception are generated on the fly
- Certificates logic compatible with [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/), saved at `~/.mitmproxy`. If you used mitmproxy before and installed certificates, then you can use this go-mitmproxy directly
- Addon mechanism, you can add your functions easily, refer to [examples](./examples)
- Performance advantages
  - Golang's inherent performance advantages
  - Forwarding and parsing HTTPS traffic in process memory without inter-process communication such as tcp port or unix socket
  - Use LRU cache when generating certificates of different domain names to avoid double counting
- Support `Wireshark` to analyze traffic through the environment variable `SSLKEYLOGFILE`
- Support streaming when uploading/downloading large files
- Web interface

## Install

```
go install github.com/kardianos/mitmproxy/cmd/mitmproxy@latest
```

## Usage

### Startup

```
go-mitmproxy
```

After startup, the HTTP proxy address defaults to port 9080, and the web interface defaults to port 9081.

After the first startup, the SSL/TLS certificate will be automatically generated at `~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem`. You can refer to this link to install: [About Certificates](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-certificates/).
